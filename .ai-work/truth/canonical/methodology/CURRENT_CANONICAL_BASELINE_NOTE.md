# v0.9.18 baseline note — AIP Convention Canonical Promotion

v0.9.18 is based on v0.9.17 plus AIP convention canonical promotion (CR-AIWS-2026-05-001 applied 2026-05-10).

Trigger: cross-project improvements observation snapshot from `vti-ai-portal` consumer project (2026-05-10) surfaced 3 AIP usage conventions worth promoting from project-level practice to canonical spec. Wiki manager (hoinv-dev) approved 3 sub-proposals via AIP-EXEC-011.

Spec changes (additive only, no breaking changes):
- `AIP_Detail_Spec_MVP.md` §3.5 NEW — Retrospective AIP authoring (ship-first emergencies). Codifies retrospective AIP convention with 4 documentation requirements (a/b/c/d) + special status flow `draft → done` (skip `active`). Adds optional metadata field `authored_retroactively`.
- `AIP_Detail_Spec_MVP.md` §4.3 NEW — Slug prefix taxonomy (recommended). Defines 6 generic prefix patterns (`t<NNN>-`, `bugfix-`, `uiux-`, `<feat>-design`, `<feat>-implementation`, `test-infra-`) for AIP slug categorization. Recommended-not-enforced; lint does not validate prefix membership.
- `AIP_Detail_Spec_MVP.md` §5.3/§5.4/§5.5 PATCH — Each metadata block adds 3 optional fields: `authored_retroactively`, `depends_on`, `related`.
- `AIP_Detail_Spec_MVP.md` §5.7 NEW — Cross-AIP relationship fields explanation. Distinguishes `depends_on` (hard dependency) from `related` (sibling, no dep) and from existing `plan_source` (typed PLAN→EXEC handoff). Format free-form.
- `AIP_Detail_Spec_MVP.md` §12.4 PATCH — Lint reference note: `depends_on`/`related` not structurally validated.
- Spec internal Version: 0.1 → 0.2.

Source basis: 1 consumer project (vti-ai-portal). Reflexive R-meta concern (single-project evidence) was surfaced in CR closing notes; wiki manager approved with awareness. Future consumer project adoptions may corroborate or surface adaptation needs.

Source artifacts:
- `C:\Dev\gitlab\vti-ai-portal\.ai-work\aiws_improvements.md` — playbook source, snapshot 2026-05-10
- `.ai-work/aip/exec/AIP-EXEC-009-aiws-improvements-batch-2026-05.md` — drafted CR
- `.ai-work/aip/exec/AIP-EXEC-011-apply-cr-aiws-2026-05-001.md` — applied CR
- `.ai-work/workspaces/TASK-20260510-aiws-improvements-batch/07_output_draft.md` D4 — full CR text

Out of scope (future sprints if needed):
- Lint enhancement to detect dangling `depends_on`/`related` references (FU-5 from AIP-EXEC-009)
- Backfill existing AIPs with new optional fields
- Renaming existing AIPs to follow §4.3 prefix taxonomy
- SKILL.md body audit beyond description audit (FU-4)

# v0.9.19 baseline note — Drift Sync + New Skill Promotion (2026-05-11)

v0.9.19 is based on v0.9.18 plus drift sync from `.ai-work/` (deployed area) back to canonical `product/` (build source), plus promotion of `personal-notebook-write-lite` skill and 2 general-purpose sensitive-data tooling files.

Trigger: drift audit 2026-05-11 (this AIP) surfaced that 11 tooling files in `.ai-work/tooling/` had accumulated improvements (+1002 net lines) not yet present in canonical `product/tooling/`, plus 1 skill (`personal-notebook-write-lite`) and 3 tooling files (`personal_notebook_write.py`, `mask_sensitive.py`, `scan_sensitive.py`) existed only in `.ai-work/` or `.claude/` but not in `product/`. Because `build_aiws_install_package.py` ships exclusively from `product/`, these improvements were at risk of NOT reaching consumer projects in the next package build. AIP-EXEC-012 promotes them to canonical.

Sync scope (additive only, no breaking changes):

**Tooling sync** — 11 files updated `.ai-work/tooling/ → product/tooling/`:
- `build_active_step_context.py` (+73 lines: `_load_jsonl_safe`, `_first_existing`, `_bullet_refs` helpers + blocking_queue logic)
- `build_wiki_source_index.py` (+47)
- `build_wiki_source_meta.py` (+82)
- `detect_changed_wiki_sources.py` (+57)
- `evaluate_wiki_source_impact.py` (+60)
- `lint_aip.py` (in-place fix: candidate parsing strips backticks)
- `lint_all.py` (-6 refactor)
- `lint_wiki.py` (+206)
- `lint_workspace.py` (+317)
- `lookup_wiki_source.py` (+57)
- `refresh_wiki_source_meta.py` (+109)

**Skill promotion** — `personal-notebook-write-lite` to canonical layout (8 new files):
- `product/skills/personal-notebook-write-lite/SKILL.md` (thin pointer)
- `product/procedural/skills/personal-notebook-write-lite/` (SKILL.md + config.example.yaml + scripts/notebook_write.py + templates/×3)
- `product/tooling/personal_notebook_write.py` (companion script)

**General-purpose tooling promotion** — 2 sensitive-data tools added to `product/tooling/`:
- `mask_sensitive.py` — markdown sensitive-info masking with placeholder mapping
- `scan_sensitive.py` — read-only sensitive-info scanner with multi-format report

**Intentionally NOT promoted** — kept as project-local helpers in `.ai-work/tooling/`:
- `build_asp_manual_metas.py` — specific to ASP manuals knowledge source in this project
- `build_canonical_package_metas.py` — specific to AIWS canonical package metas in this project

R-meta concern (process): the drift cycle occurred because improvements were authored directly in `.ai-work/` (deployed area) instead of `product/` (canonical). Memory rule `feedback_tooling_edit_flow.md` already documents the expected flow (edit only in `product/`, deploy via install/update). This v0.9.19 sprint is a one-time remediation. Future improvements MUST flow `product/ → install → .ai-work/`. No recurring drift cycle should be tolerated.

Source artifacts:
- `.ai-work/aip/exec/AIP-EXEC-012-aiws-canonical-sync-and-package-v0_9_19.md` — this AIP
- `.ai-work/workspaces/TASK-20260511-exec-012/04_findings.md` — full drift inventory + per-step evidence
- `.ai-work/workspaces/TASK-20260511-exec-012/11_output_final.md` — final report (after STEP-06)

Out of scope (future sprints if needed):
- FU-4 (SKILL.md body audit) — deferred from AIP-EXEC-009/011
- FU-5 (lint dangling refs detection) — deferred from AIP-EXEC-009/011
- Git release tag `v0.9.19` on `mvp_final` branch — user-decided
- Consumer project propagation (FE, CEC, BSN-WithAI, vti-ai-portal) — handled by their `/update-aiws-package` cycles


# 2026-06-19 baseline note — AIWS Change Request Spec (CR-AIWS-2026-06-030)

Adds `20_specs/AIWS_Change_Request_Spec_MVP.md` as the general AIWS-wide CR authority (`WIKI_CHANGE_REQUEST_SPEC` = wiki-meta profile). Codifies month-scoped + cross-branch CR-id allocation discipline (CAP-001) and the 3 CR-authoring conventions absorbed from AIP-093. Applied via AIP-EXEC-086 (governing CR-AIWS-2026-06-030).
