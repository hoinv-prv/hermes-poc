## 1. Knowledge Hub Add/Update Checklist

```markdown
# Knowledge Hub Add/Update Checklist

## 0. Operation type
- [ ] Is this add / update / merge / replace / archive / promote_candidate?
- [ ] Is the target Knowledge Hub area clear?

## 1. Knowledge Value
- [ ] What specific value does this knowledge provide for AI runtime retrieval/reasoning/task execution?
- [ ] Which future task/use case will AI use this for?
- [ ] Does it help AI work more efficiently and/or produce higher-quality output?

## 2. Knowledge role / purpose
- [ ] Is the role clear: source_of_truth / source_derived_reference / curated_reference / best_practice / lesson_learned / usecase_specific_note / simple_reference_note?
- [ ] Is the authority level clear enough to prevent over-trust?

## 3. Source / context
- [ ] Is source/provenance available if source-backed?
- [ ] Is task/context recorded if lesson learned or best practice?
- [ ] Is freshness/currentness clear?

## 4. Target fit
- [ ] Is Knowledge Hub really the right target?
- [ ] Should this instead be Notebook / Workspace / appendix / guideline / backlog / discard?

## 5. Duplication / conflict
- [ ] Does similar knowledge already exist?
- [ ] Should this update/merge an existing entry instead of adding new content?
- [ ] Does it conflict with canonical docs or existing Knowledge Hub entries?

## 6. Risk / uncertainty
- [ ] What remains uncertain?
- [ ] Could this be over-generalized?
- [ ] Could adding/updating this reduce Knowledge Hub quality?

## 7. Review decision
- [ ] ready_to_add_update
- [ ] needs_value_clarification
- [ ] needs_source_check
- [ ] needs_owner_review
- [ ] better_as_appendix/guideline/backlog
- [ ] retain_local
- [ ] discard_recommended

## 7. AIP Template snippet

```markdown
## Post-feedback Knowledge Promotion Lookback

When HUMAN accepts the fixed output, perform a short lookback.

Collect:
- improvement candidates
- missed findings
- lessons learned
- reusable HUMAN feedback patterns
- Knowledge Promotion candidates
- future backlog candidates

For each candidate, include:
- Knowledge Value
- future AI-use case
- suggested target
- review needed
- apply-back status

Guardrails:
- do not auto-promote
- do not auto-update Knowledge Hub
- do not auto-update AIP Template/guideline/prompt/playbook/process
- mark apply-back as deferred unless separately approved
- skip if HUMAN explicitly says no lookback is needed
```

Please collect improvement candidates, missed findings, lessons learned, and Knowledge Promotion candidates.
