## 3. Key decisions

1. Knowledge Hub is primarily for AI runtime value.
2. HUMAN guides/reviews/controls; AI is primary runtime consumer.
3. Knowledge Value means helping AI work more efficiently and/or produce higher-quality outputs.
4. Notebook can store any.
5. Candidate can be broad and intermediate.
6. Wiki / Knowledge Hub requires Knowledge Value.
7. Important promotion/add/update is controlled.
8. `knowledge-hub-add-update` must use the Knowledge Hub Add/Update Checklist.
9. AI can collect/prepare candidates but must not auto-promote.
10. Post-feedback lookback captures improvement value.
11. `run-aip` should remind/check lookback for relevant AIPs.
12. Important promotion/improvement must be logged for review/revision/rollback.
