# AIWS_WSB-08_SAMPLE_WORKSPACE_STRUCTURE_AND_FLOWS_v1

Status: Draft  
Sprint: Workspace Boundary Minimal Spec Sprint  
Baseline: AI Work System MVP v0.9.9

---

## 1. Purpose

WSB-08 provides sample Workspace structures and flows.

The goal is to demonstrate how Workspace should be used without confusing it with Working AIP, Knowledge Hub, Notebook, or canonical docs.

---

## 2. Sample Workspace structure

```markdown
# Workspace — <task/session name>

## 1. Workspace Identity
- workspace_id:
- task/session name:
- status: active / paused / closing / closed / archived
- created_at:
- updated_at:
- related sprint/component:
- active Working AIP:

## 2. Task Summary
- HUMAN request:
- interpreted intent:
- expected output:
- scope note:

## 3. Current State
- current step:
- completed:
- next action:
- blockers:

## 4. Selected Sources / Context
| Ref | Type | Role | Status | Usage / Limitation |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## 5. Task Lens / Mode
- selected lens/mode:
- reason:
- expansion note:

## 6. Runtime Queue
- Queue file: `02_runtime_queue.jsonl`
- Compatibility alias: `02_investigation_queue.jsonl`
- Purpose: follow-up work items for current task

## 7. Open Questions / Blockers
- ...

## 7. Intermediate Findings
- ...

## 8. Draft Outputs / Working Files
- ...

## 9. Feedback / Fix Notes
- ...

## 10. Capture Inbox / Candidates for Lookback / Promotion
- Capture Inbox file: `08_capture_inbox.jsonl`

| Candidate | Type | Status | Suggested target |
|---|---|---|---|

## 11. Next Actions
- ...

## 12. Close / Archive Notes
- final output:
- accepted by HUMAN:
- candidates created:
- notes moved/discarded:
- archive location:
```

This is a recommended structure. Small tasks may use a lighter structure.

# 3. Sample Flow 1 — Sprint design task

## 3.1. Context

HUMAN says:

```text
Ok, hãy bắt đầu sprint.
```

Task:
- new sprint
- multi-step design
- Workspace useful
- Working AIP may be needed before execution/package

## 3.2. Workspace

```markdown
# Workspace — Workspace Boundary Minimal Spec Sprint

## Workspace Identity
- workspace_id: WS-WORKSPACE-BOUNDARY-2026-04-26
- status: active
- related sprint/component: Workspace Boundary Minimal Spec
- active Working AIP: not created yet / to be created if execution becomes non-trivial

## Task Summary
- HUMAN request: Start Workspace Boundary Minimal Spec Sprint.
- interpreted intent: define minimal Workspace boundary for AIWS MVP.
- expected output: WSB docs, close review, package after HUMAN confirmation.

## Current State
- completed: WSB-01~WSB-03 drafted
- current step: WSB-04 runtime flow
- next action: WSB-05 handoff rule
- blockers: none

## Selected Sources / Context
| Ref | Type | Role | Status | Usage / Limitation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AIWS v0.9.9 | baseline package | current canonical baseline | active | use as design baseline |
| Working AIP Connection sprint | previous sprint | boundary dependency | closed | Workspace feeds Working AIP |

## Candidates for Lookback / Promotion
- none yet
```

## 3.3. Correct behavior

Workspace tracks sprint progress.  
It does not replace WSB docs or Working AIP.

---

# 4. Sample Flow 2 — Continuation task

## 4.1. HUMAN request

```text
Hãy tiếp tục nhé.
```

## 4.2. Runtime flow

```text
HUMAN continuation request
  ↓
identify current Workspace
  ↓
read Current State / Next Actions
  ↓
continue next WSB item
  ↓
update Workspace
```

## 4.3. Workspace update

```markdown
## Current State
- completed: WSB-01~WSB-04
- current step: WSB-05 Workspace to Working AIP Handoff Rule
- next action: WSB-06 Workspace to Knowledge Promotion Candidate Rule
- blockers: none
```

## 4.4. Guardrail

Do not infer a new task from “continue” if current Workspace context is clear.

If multiple active workspaces exist, ask/confirm.

---

# 5. Sample Flow 3 — Source-heavy review task

## 5.1. Task

Review Detail Design against Requirement and Basic Design.

## 5.2. Workspace

Workspace stores:
- selected RD/BD/DD sources
- current review status
- open findings
- draft review report pointer
- source representation issues
- follow-up candidates

## 5.3. Working AIP handoff

Workspace selected sources become Working AIP Context / Source References.

Workspace findings do not become final review findings until source-checked and represented in output.

---

# 6. Sample Flow 4 — Package creation task

## 6.1. Task

Create canonical package after sprint close.

## 6.2. Workspace role

Workspace tracks:
- baseline package
- target version
- canonical merge map
- changed files
- delta tracking folder
- output zip/report paths
- validation steps
- package creation issues

## 6.3. Boundary

Package output is not Workspace.

Workspace records package output pointer after creation.

---

# 7. Sample Flow 5 — Candidate collection after feedback

## 7.1. Task

AI creates document, HUMAN gives feedback, AI fixes, HUMAN accepts.

## 7.2. Workspace records

```markdown
## Feedback / Fix Notes
- HUMAN feedback: add source representation caution.
- Fix applied: WMI spec updated with caution.

## Candidates for Lookback / Promotion
| Candidate | Type | Status | Suggested target |
|---|---|---|---|
| Add source representation caution to template | AIP Template improvement | draft_candidate | future apply-back task |
```

## 7.3. Boundary

Candidate is not promoted automatically.

---

# 8. Sample Flow 6 — Personal idea during task

## 8.1. Situation

During task, HUMAN has idea unrelated to current sprint but useful later.

## 8.2. Workspace handling

Workspace can temporarily record:

```markdown
## Intermediate Findings
- Personal idea: consider a future UI dashboard for workspace states.
```

At close:
- move/copy to Notebook if HUMAN wants
- or future backlog candidate
- not Knowledge Hub by default

---

# 9. Sample Flow 7 — Source representation issue

## 9.1. Situation

Converted Excel markdown misses formulas.

## 9.2. Workspace records

```markdown
## Open Questions / Blockers
- source_representation_quality_issue: converted testcase markdown may omit formulas.

## Candidates for Lookback / Promotion
| Candidate | Type | Status | Suggested target |
|---|---|---|---|
| Improve Excel conversion guideline | source representation improvement | draft_candidate | conversion skill/guideline |
```

## 9.3. Boundary

If it blocks current task, reflect into Working AIP blocker.  
If reusable, create candidate.  
Do not treat Workspace note as verified source.

---

# 10. Cross-sample checklist

```markdown
- [ ] Workspace is task/session-bound
- [ ] Workspace records current state
- [ ] active Working AIP pointer is recorded if applicable
- [ ] selected sources/context are role-defined
- [ ] open questions/blockers are visible
- [ ] candidates are marked as candidates
- [ ] final outputs are linked, not stored only in Workspace
- [ ] task close classification is done
- [ ] Workspace is closed/archived when task completes
```

---

## 11. Conclusion

WSB-08 provides practical examples of Workspace usage.

Core lesson:

```text
Workspace is the working area for task continuity.
It supports but does not replace execution, knowledge, notebook, or canonical layers.
```

# 11. Sample Flow 8 — Capture Inbox triage

## 11.1. Situation

During a task, AI finds several potentially reusable observations:
- a missing Wiki Meta lookup key
- a repeated HUMAN feedback pattern
- a source representation issue
- a personal idea that may be useful later

## 11.2. Runtime capture

AI records them in:

```text
08_capture_inbox.jsonl
```

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "C-001",
  "type": "wiki_meta_update_candidate",
  "title": "Add Japanese alias lookup key for F02 SearchRoom",
  "content": "During review, source lookup failed until Japanese alias 会議室検索 was used.",
  "status": "captured",
  "suggested_target": "wiki_meta",
  "source_refs": ["SRC-RD-F02-SEARCHROOM"],
  "notes": "Triage at workspace close."
}
```

## 11.3. Close triage

At Workspace close:

| Capture item | Classification |
|---|---|
| missing lookup key | lightweight maintenance / Wiki Meta candidate |
| repeated HUMAN feedback | AIP Template improvement candidate |
| source representation issue | source representation improvement candidate |
| personal idea | Notebook note or future backlog |
| low-value note | discard |

## 11.4. Guardrail

Capture Inbox item is not promoted automatically.

# 12. Sample Flow 9 — Workspace Runtime Queue for emergent follow-up work

## 12.1. Situation

During a package creation task, AI is updating files and discovers follow-up work items:

- update MANIFEST after files are generated
- update CHANGELOG after canonical docs are changed
- verify delta tracking folder before zip
- check package report includes all added files

These were not all listed explicitly in the initial chat request.

## 12.2. Queue capture

AI writes follow-up work items into:

```text
02_runtime_queue.jsonl
```

Example item:

```json
{
  "id": "Q-002",
  "title": "Update CHANGELOG after canonical docs are changed",
  "status": "pending",
  "priority": "high",
  "type": "changelog_manifest_step",
  "reason": "CHANGELOG must reflect canonical package changes before close.",
  "origin": "package creation execution",
  "next_action": "After docs are updated, append v0.9.x changelog entry.",
  "blocking": true,
  "result": ""
}
```

## 12.3. Processing loop

AI continues the current file update step.

At checkpoint:
1. Review pending high-priority queue items.
2. Process CHANGELOG and MANIFEST updates.
3. Mark queue items resolved.
4. Reflect completion in Workspace close notes.

## 12.4. Guardrail

Runtime Queue item is not a Knowledge Promotion Candidate by default.

If queue processing reveals reusable value, create or copy a separate Capture Inbox item.
