# Minimal Runtime Testing Stance Sprint Merge Summary

Version: v0.9.11  
Date: 2026-04-26  
Status: Canonical merge summary  
Baseline: AI Work System MVP v0.9.10  
Update scope: Minimal Runtime Testing Stance Sprint

---

## 1. Purpose

This document records how the Minimal Runtime Testing Stance Sprint is reflected into the canonical AI Work System package.

---

## 2. Sprint outputs integrated

The sprint adds MVP coverage for:

- Minimal Runtime Testing Stance concept and purpose
- core runtime correctness principles
- minimal runtime checkpoints
- component boundary test viewpoints
- minimal runtime test case set
- package/sprint close sanity checklist
- anti-patterns and failure modes
- relation to future testing/scoring/telemetry
- baseline reference rule for v0.9.2
- v0.9.2 preservation findings as lookback/future candidates
- Wiki tools baseline preservation findings

---

## 3. Key decisions

1. Minimal runtime testing checks whether AIWS follows runtime guardrails and component boundaries.
2. Deterministic checks and manual checkpoints are guardrails, not semantic review.
3. Correctness comes before optimization.
4. Runtime guardrails come before scoring.
5. Manual/minimal checks come before full automation.
6. lint/check is guardrail, not reviewer.
7. run-aip prepares runtime, not semantic execution.
8. v0.9.2 is baseline/reference, not design direction.
9. Future testing/scoring/telemetry is deferred.
