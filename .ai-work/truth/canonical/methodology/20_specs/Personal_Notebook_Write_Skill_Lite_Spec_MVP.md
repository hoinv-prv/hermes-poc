# Personal Notebook Write Skill Lite Spec MVP

Version: v0.9.4  
Date: 2026-04-25  
Status: Canonical skill support spec

---

## 1. Purpose

Personal Notebook Write Skill Lite is a small reusable execution capability that helps AI/HUMAN create, append, and lightly update Personal Notebook notes according to MVP notebook rules.

It exists to make the file-based Personal Notebook usable without requiring a full notebook application.

---

## 2. Scope

Supported MVP operations:

- `init_notebook`
- `append_inbox_note`
- `create_note_file`
- `update_note`
- `mark_capture_candidate`
- `archive_note`

---

## 3. Guardrails

The skill must not:

- become decision authority
- become orchestrator
- update Knowledge Hub
- update canonical docs
- auto-promote notes
- mark content as approved
- treat notes as source of truth
- silently write without HUMAN request/confirmation by default

---

## 4. Customization points

The skill is intentionally customizable:

- folder layout
- filename rule
- required metadata fields
- status vocabulary
- authority vocabulary
- confirmation policy
- sensitivity policy

Local customization is allowed as long as the core guardrails remain intact.
