# Canonical Design Set Update Changelog v0.2
Version: 0.2  
Status: Changelog for canonical merge through current point

> **2026-05-30 update (CR-AIWS-2026-05-020 / AIP-EXEC-038):** The **Knowledge Object** layer recorded in this
> changelog (`Knowledge_Object_Model_Spec`, `Knowledge_Expansion_Link_Spec`, the object-model/expansion entries
> below) was **removed** by CR-AIWS-2026-05-005 ("not earning its complexity"). The canonical model is now
> **2-layer** (artifact-level meta + index; cross-artifact relationships via `## Related Sources`). The two specs
> were rewritten to the 2-layer model (CR-020). Entries below remain as the historical v0.2 record.

# 1. Summary

This update completes the main Knowledge Hub delta merge into the canonical current baseline.

---

# 2. New canonical docs added

- `Knowledge_Object_Model_Spec_MVP_v0_1.md`
- `Knowledge_Routing_Spec_MVP_v0_1.md`
- `Knowledge_Expansion_Link_Spec_MVP_v0_1.md`
- `Knowledge_Access_Interface_Spec_MVP_v0_1.md`

---

# 3. Canonical docs updated

- `Architecture_Design_MVP_v0_5.md`
- `Basic_Design_MVP_v0_4.md`
- `AI_Work_System_MVP_Specs_Guidelines_Index_v0_4.md`

---

# 4. Main changes reflected in canonical

- Knowledge Hub is now canonically described as supporting:
  - object model
  - routing
  - expansion
  - access interface
- Knowledge Hub is no longer presented only as an active branch in the specs index
- Expansion link model was simplified in the canonical spec to:
  - `parent`
  - `input`
  - `related`
  - `reference`
- Expansion-link lifecycle was explicitly reflected:
  - Working AIP
  - local wiki
  - project wiki
  - source meta / source artifact / wiki meta
- Architecture and Basic Design are now wording-aligned with the merged Knowledge Hub baseline

---

# 5. Important note

This changelog does not claim that all future refinement work is finished.
It only records that the current major delta branch has now been absorbed into the canonical baseline through the present point.
