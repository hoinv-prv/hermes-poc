# Step Output / Decision / Discussion Traceability Spec MVP

Status: Canonical MVP spec  
Version: v0.9.16  
Date: 2026-04-26  
Source sprint: Active Step Context Minimal Spec Sprint

---

## 1. Purpose

This spec defines Step Output / Decision / Discussion Traceability as a core AIWS feature.

The goal is to ensure important step outputs, decisions, conclusions, and the HUMAN–AI discussion process that produced them are persisted for handoff, review, tracking, and improvement.

---

## 2. Central rule

```text
Important step outputs, HUMAN–AI interaction-derived decisions/conclusions,
and the key discussion process that led to them
must be persisted in Workspace with trace metadata.
```

---

## 3. Persistable step results

A step result includes:
- generated output
- HUMAN–AI interaction-derived conclusion
- decision
- assumption
- Q&A clarification
- review judgment
- accepted limitation
- agreed direction / scope interpretation
- key discussion process that led to decision/conclusion

---

## 4. Step Output Artifact

The actual output created by a step.

Examples:
- clarified requirement
- design draft
- review findings
- Q&A summary
- source investigation result
- test viewpoint list
- migration report
- patch proposal

---

## 5. Step Decision / Conclusion Artifact

A persisted record of a conclusion, decision, assumption, clarification, or review judgment formed through HUMAN–AI interaction during a step.

---

## 6. Decision Discussion Trace

A persisted structured summary of the HUMAN–AI exchange process that led to a decision/conclusion.

It should preserve enough context to review why the decision was made, without requiring full chat transcript by default.

Minimum trace content:
- question_or_issue
- options_considered
- ai_recommendations
- human_inputs
- decision_points
- rejected_options
- rationale
- final_decision
- accepted_assumptions
- limitations
- unresolved_points
- source_refs
- used_by_steps
- used_by_final_output

---

## 7. Step Output Meta model

Recommended minimum:

```yaml
output_id:
result_type:
working_aip_ref:
step_id:
step_title:
output_type:
output_locator:
decision_summary:
conversation_refs:
discussion_trace_locator:
created_at:
created_by:
input_refs:
source_refs:
used_by_steps:
used_by_final_output:
review_status:
accepted_by:
reviewed_by:
limitation:
promotion_candidate:
improvement_candidate:
```

---

## 8. Decision Discussion Trace model

Recommended minimum:

```yaml
discussion_trace_id:
related_output_id:
working_aip_ref:
step_id:
discussion_trace_locator:
discussion_summary:
question_or_issue:
options_considered:
ai_recommendations:
human_inputs:
decision_points:
rejected_options:
rationale:
final_decision:
accepted_assumptions:
limitations:
unresolved_points:
source_refs:
created_at:
created_by:
used_by_steps:
used_by_final_output:
```

---

## 9. Review status values

Recommended:

```text
draft
ready_for_review
reviewed
approved_for_next_step
needs_revision
rejected
superseded
archived
unknown
```

Important:

```text
approved_for_next_step does not mean Knowledge Hub promotion.
```

---

## 10. Handoff rule

Step result handoff should be explicit:

```text
Step A output/decision/discussion trace → Step B input or final output
```

This relationship must be traceable by ID/pointer.

---

## 11. Source verification trace

If a step output uses source evidence, metadata should record:

```yaml
source_refs:
  - source_id:
    locator:
    verification_level:
    limitation:
```

This connects step output trace to Source Representation / Conversion Integration.

---

## 12. Improvement / lookback

Step trace supports:
- finding where misunderstanding started
- identifying weak rationale
- detecting missing source verification
- debugging downstream issue
- creating AIP/template/guideline improvement candidates
- creating Knowledge Promotion candidates

---

## 13. Non-goals

This spec does not define:
- full artifact registry
- full version control system
- full review workflow engine
- UI for output tracking
- automatic quality scoring
- automatic promotion to Knowledge Hub

---

## 14. Conclusion

Traceability ensures later steps and final outputs depend on explicit Workspace artifacts, not hidden chat context.
