# AIWS_WTA-10_MINIMAL_PATCH_MAP_AND_CANONICAL_MERGE_MAP_v1

Status: Draft  
Sprint: Wiki Tooling Alignment Sprint  
Baseline: AI Work System MVP v0.9.12

---

## 1. Purpose

WTA-10 defines a minimal patch map and canonical merge map for Wiki Tooling Alignment Sprint.

This prepares future canonical merge / package update.

---

## 2. Implementation stance

```text
Patch minimally.
Preserve compatibility.
Avoid full Knowledge Hub rewrite.
No auto-promotion.
```

---

## 3. Patch priority

Recommended priorities:

```text
P0 — must align before next Wiki tooling package update if possible
P1 — should align soon
P2 — future sprint candidate
```

---

- avoid approval wording
- optionally emit Capture Inbox candidate snippet

Targets:
```text
payload/tooling/detect_changed_wiki_sources.py

### P1-03. skills alignment

Patch:
- update `lookup-wiki-source`
- update `refresh-wiki-source-meta`
- update `build-wiki-source-meta`
- add no-auto-promotion and source verification wording

---

## 6. P2 / future candidates

### P2-01. Full Wiki Tooling Alignment implementation

Could be done if current sprint only merges design.

### P2-02. Wiki Source Maintenance / Impact Detection Sprint

Dedicated flow:
- detect changed source
- evaluate impact
- create candidate
- refresh draft
- review/apply
- log/rollback

### P2-03. Source Representation / Conversion Integration Sprint

Dedicated source conversion/representation quality sprint.

### P2-04. Code Source Profile Sprint

For `build_java_wiki_metas.py`, Graphify/call graph, language-specific source profiles.

### P2-05. Local/Common Knowledge Integration Sprint

For `add-local-knowledge`, local knowledge overview, common/project boundary.

---

## 7. Compatibility test checklist

After patching, test:

### Old meta/index

```markdown
- [ ] old meta loads
- [ ] old index loads
- [ ] missing new optional fields produce warning/info, not hard error
```

### New meta/index

```markdown
- [ ] new optional fields accepted
- [ ] source representation fields accepted
- [ ] promotion status fields accepted
- [ ] index stays lightweight
```

### Lookup

```markdown
- [ ] lookup output says candidate route/context
- [ ] exact evidence still points to source artifact
- [ ] representation caution displayed if present
```

### Refresh/apply

```markdown
- [ ] default creates draft
- [ ] apply is explicit
- [ ] high-impact changes require review/log
- [ ] no auto-promotion wording
```

### Impact

```markdown
- [ ] impact result is signal/recommendation
- [ ] candidate flow is suggested, not applied
- [ ] no approval wording
```

## 10. Core snippets to merge

### Wiki tooling central stance

```markdown
Wiki tools help AI route, refresh, detect changes, and check structure.
They do not approve knowledge, replace source verification, or auto-promote candidates.
```

### Lookup boundary

```markdown
lookup-wiki-source is a routing tool.
It helps AI find candidate source/meta routes.
It does not replace source artifact verification.
```

### Refresh boundary

```markdown
Refresh creates draft/update candidate by default.
Apply is explicit, reviewed, logged, and rollback-aware.
Refresh is not promotion.
```

### Impact boundary

```markdown
Detect/evaluate tools produce signals and candidates.
They do not approve or apply Knowledge Hub updates.
```

### Representation quality

```markdown
Wiki tools should surface source representation quality/caution so AI can avoid overclaiming source verification.
```

## 11. Deferred items

Do not merge as current commitment:
- full Knowledge Hub governance rewrite
- full metadata registry framework
- semantic scoring
- auto-promotion
- auto-update Knowledge Hub
- Graphify/call graph integration
- full code profile framework
- full CI/testing harness
- full source conversion framework

---

## 12. Sprint close readiness check

Before close, confirm:

```markdown
- [ ] WTA scope accepted
- [ ] compatibility matrix accepted
- [ ] Meta/Index schema alignment accepted
- [ ] lookup boundary accepted
- [ ] refresh draft/apply boundary accepted
- [ ] detect/evaluate candidate flow accepted
- [ ] source representation quality integration accepted
- [ ] lint_wiki alignment accepted

## 13. Conclusion

WTA-10 prepares canonical merge and future patching for Wiki Tooling Alignment.

Central merge message:

```text
Wiki tools support AI runtime routing and maintenance,
but they do not replace source verification, approval, or Controlled Knowledge Promotion.
```
